# Design
###### Status: Initial draft

> The virtual machine doesn't have a name yet, but to keep it short,
we refer to it as `the machine`.

This document contains the specification for available registers, error codes,
a list of instructions together with their arguments and descriptions.

For the specification on binary encoding, check the [encoding.md](./encoding.md) file.

## Error codes

| Name                    | Value  | Description                                                       |
|-------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `REGULAR_EXIT`          | `0x00` | The machine exited normally                                       |
| `STACKOVERFLOW`         | `0x01` | Operation would overflow the stack                                |
| `ILLEGAL_MEMORY_ACCESS` | `0x03` | Memory read or write is out-of-bounds                             |
| `INVALID_INSTRUCTION`   | `0x04` | Unknown instruction                                               |
| `INVALID_REGISTER`      | `0x05` | Unknown register                                                  |

| `OUT_OF_MEMORY`         | `0x07` | Not enough memory to load a program                               |

## Registers

| Name           | Description         |
|----------------|---------------------|
| `r0` .. `r59`  | General purpose     |
| `ip`           | Instruction pointer |
| `sp`           | Stack pointer       |
| `fp`           | Frame pointer       |
| `flags`        | Flags register      |

- `ip` holds a pointer to the current instruction
- `sp` holds a pointer to the first byte above the stack
- `fp` holds a pointer to the base of the current stack-frame
- `flags` each bit is a specific flag that can be set by other instructions

```
00000000
^^^^^^^^
||||||||
|||||||+-- Overflow flag - Set if the last operation overflowed
|||||||
||||||+-- Parity flag - Set if the number of set bits is even in the result of the last operation
||||||
|||||+-- Zero flag - Set if the last operation resulted in zero
|||||
||||+-- Negative flag - Set if the most significant bit
||||
|||+-- Carry flag - Set if the last operation caused an arithmetic carry out of the most significant bit
|||
||+-- Reserved
||
|+-- Reserved
|
+-- Reserved
```

Currently, only the lower `byte` of the `flags` register has anything meaningful in it. All other bytes
are untouched by the machine.

Registers can hold a 64-bit value. You can also target the lower `dword`, `word` or `byte` of a register.
Do so by appending either `d`, `w`, or `b` to the end of the register name. Below is a visual representation
of how a register can be accessed:

```
r0:   00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
r0d:  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
r0w:  00000000 00000000
r0b:  00000000
```

If you try to write a value bigger than the capacity of a register(e.g `mov r0b, r0w`), the value is trimmed.

```assembly
; Before
;
; r0w: 00000011 11000000
; r0b: 00000000

mov r0b, r0w

; After
;
; r0b: 00000011
```

## Memory

The machine can be initialized with a variable amount of memory. The stack grows towards high
addresses.

## Size specifiers

Size specifiers can be used to describe a given amount of bytes.

A few constants are available for commonly used sizes.

- `byte` - `1 byte`
- `word` - `2 bytes`
- `dword` - `4 bytes`
- `qword` - `8 bytes`

## Instructions

Instructions are names assigned to a specific opcode. Opcodes range from `0` to `255`.
For more information, [see encoding.md](./encoding.md).

## Instruction descriptions

Each instruction in the machine is documented below.
The `Arguments` section, if present, follows the following naming convention:

- `value` Immediate value.
- `reg` Register descriptor.
- `type` Size specifier (e.g `byte` or `word`).

If a register is surrounded with brackets it's to be interpreted as a pointer.

## Floating-point arithmetic instructions

If a full mode register is passed, the type is assumbed to be `float`, if the register
is in DWORD mode, `double` is assumed. When trying to store in a register that has
insufficient size, the result will be truncated.

## Miscellaneous instructions

| `nop`     | Does nothing |
| `syscall` | VM syscall   |

## Syscalls

Syscalls are subroutines implemented directly inside the machine that provide some useful functionality,
such as doing IO or getting input from the user. To make a syscall, push any arguments first and the
syscall id onto the stack. The syscall id is a `word`.

### Available syscalls

| Name       | Opcode | Arguments | Description                                                 |

| `exit`     | `0x00` | code      | Halt the machine with `code` as the exit code (single byte) |
| `debugger` | `0x01` | arg       | Breakpoint for debuggers.                                   |
| `grow`     | `0x02` |           | Doubles the machines memory. Pushes `0_u32` on error        |

Return values of syscalls are pushed onto the stack. Different syscalls may produce different return values.
